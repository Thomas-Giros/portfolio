Spim uses Google voice recognition to allow you to get a constant flow of images on your device. You can chose if you want to display your speech results , how do you want to display your images and what kind of images you want to show.
For example you can use a color filter, blue, to get images with predominant blue color, and you can click on the GIF icon to get only gifs.
